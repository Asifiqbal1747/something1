<h2> 1. write a program that asks the user for a positive integer 
value.The program should use a loop to get the sum of the integers
from 1 up to the number entered. For example, if the user enters 50,
the loop will find the sum of 1,2,3,.....50.    </h2>

<h2> 5. The distance a vehicle travels can be calculated as follows:

distance = speed * time

For example, if a train travels 40 miles per hour for 3 hours, the distance traveled is 120 miles.
Write a program that asks the user for the speed of a vehical (in miles per hour) and how many hours 
it has traveled. The program should then use a loop to display the distance the vehical has 
traveled for each hour of that time period.Here is an example of the output: <br>
<br>
What is the speed of the vehical in mph? 40
<br>
<br>
How many hours has ot traveled?3
